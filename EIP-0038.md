Motivation 
----------

The goal of this proposal is to return governance power to miners to give it parity with Ergo’s launch. When Ergo launched, it’s mining algorithm Autolykos
did not support outsourcability, and as such each miner was forced to solo mine. Ergo’s governance model, requiring a 90% supermajority to pass soft and hard forks,
was built with the same assumptions: that each miner would be solo mining and thus would vote for or against changes to the network as they see fit.
With Autolykos 2, non-outsourcability was disabled such that miners could join traditional stratum pools. This changed the assumptions of Ergo’s governance model:
a solo miner now has to compete with pooled miners for blocks (and therefor their right to vote). A miner could choose to join a stratum pool, but are dependent on
the pool developers and their willingness and capability to support a miner’s vote. Furthermore, even if a pool holds an internal vote in some way, the pool in still
limited by the protocol to be either entirely for or against any given change. Regardless of a pool’s desire to abide it’s miners' votes accurately, it still must
censor some of them (unless they are unanimous)

By enabling partial voting, mining pools that desire to give governance rights back to miners need only track their miner’s votes, and could submit them directly to
the network. (e.g. 91.56% of the hashrate on GetBlok is in favor of EIP 39 when it mines a block. GetBlok’s submits a block header with that block with the value
of 0.9156 in favour of the fork; WoolyPool mines the next block, 82% in favour, submitting a 0.82 value in favour of the fork; GetBlok mines the next block, this
time their miners indicated 0.931 in favour of the change, etc, etc.)

There is an alternative to hard-forking to achieve similar results but it has large hardware overhead requirement for central pool operators, and requires splitting
the hashrate of traditonal mining pools into smaller, but still centrally controlled fragments. The viability of this no-fork solution should be explored more
thoroughly before forcing order on this hard-fork solution, as future decentralized smartpool development could render this issue obsolete.
