Motivation 
----------

The goal of this proposal is to return governance power to miners to give it parity with Ergo’s launch. When Ergo launched, it’s mining algorithm Autolykos
did not support outsourcability, and as such each miner was forced to solo mine. Ergo’s governance model, requiring a 90% supermajority to pass soft and hard forks,
was built with the same assumptions: that each miner would be solo mining and thus would vote for or against changes to the network as they see fit.
With Autolykos 2, non-outsourcability was disabled such that miners could join traditional stratum pools. This changed the assumptions of Ergo’s governance model:
a solo miner now has to compete with pooled miners for blocks (and therefor their right to vote). A miner could choose to join a stratum pool, but are dependent on
the pool developers and their willingness and capability to support a miner’s vote. Furthermore, even if a pool holds an internal vote in some way, the pool in still
limited by the protocol to be either entirely for or against any given change: regardless of a pool’s desire to abide it’s miners' votes accurately, it still must
censor some of them (unless they are unanimous).

By enabling partial voting, mining pools that desire to give governance rights back to miners need only track their miner’s votes, and could submit them directly to
the network. (e.g. 91.56% of the hashrate on GetBlok is in favor of EIP 39 when it mines a block. GetBlok’s submits a block header with that block with the value
of 0.9156 in favour of the fork; WoolyPool mines the next block, 82% in favour, submitting a 0.82 value in favour of the fork; GetBlok mines the next block, this
time their miners indicated 0.931 in favour of the change, etc, etc.)

There is an alternative to hard-forking to achieve similar results but it has large hardware overhead requirement for central pool operators, and requires splitting
the hashrate of traditonal mining pools into smaller fragments. The viability of this no-fork solution should be explored more thoroughly before forcing order on this hard-fork solution, as future decentralized smartpool development could render the need for this EIP obsolete.
The greatest downside to this solution is that the nature of voting occuring over epochs means that miners that choose to support smaller pools, or solo mine using their own nodes, will decrease the odds that blocks mined with their voting preference (when compared with a protcol that can support partial voting). While this solution should be pursured regardless for its benefits to network security, there will always be incentive to join larger traditional pools supporting a miner's preference during voting epochs.

In summary: Disabling non-outsourcability introduced the ability and necessity for pools to censor a nonunanimous group of miners, and an incentive for miners to join pools during voting epochs to have their votes counted. By enabling additional validation logic to count partial votes, we can enable pools to report their miner's votes accurately, mitigate censorship, and return governance power to miners.


The Hard Fork Solution
-------------------------

We introduce new validation logic to the Ergo Node such that miners may optionally report partial support for any given change, while maintaining all other rules. As old nodes would be incapable of recogizing this partial support, a hard fork is required as attempting to soft-fork would likely result in future chainsplitting.

(The accuracy of the below technical solution is unlikely to be accurate. I do not have a development background, this is my best guess on how this change could be implemented based on my amateur capacity to parse Scala.)

I believe we need to edit several files: Those referencing votingData, voteCount, VotingTargets, Paramaters, ValidationRules, votingSettings and to serialize the new data that we miners will transmit in the extention block similarly to how paramater changes are proposed currently. We will likely need to change the boolean nature of voting, with an additional serialization step.

```scala
package org.ergoplatform.nodeView.state

import scorex.core.serialization.ScorexSerializer
import scorex.util.serialization.{Reader, Writer}
import scorex.util.Extensions._

case class VotingData(epochVotes: Array[(Byte, Int)]) {

  def update(voteFor: Byte): VotingData = {
    this.copy(epochVotes = epochVotes.map { case (id, votes) =>
      if (id == voteFor) id -> (votes + 1) else id -> votes
    })
  }

  override def canEqual(that: Any): Boolean = that.isInstanceOf[VotingData]

  override def equals(obj: scala.Any): Boolean = obj match {
    case v: VotingData => v.epochVotes.sameElements(this.epochVotes)
    case _ => false
  }

}

object VotingData {
  val empty = VotingData(Array.empty)
}

object VotingDataSerializer extends ScorexSerializer[VotingData] {

  override def serialize(obj: VotingData, w: Writer): Unit = {
    w.putUShort(obj.epochVotes.length)
    obj.epochVotes.foreach { case (id, cnt) =>
      w.put(id)
      w.putUInt(cnt)
    }
  }

  override def parse(r: Reader): VotingData = {
    val votesCount = r.getUShort()
    val epochVotes = (0 until votesCount).map {_ =>
      r.getByte() -> r.getUInt().toIntExact
    }
    VotingData(epochVotes.toArray)
  }

}
```
In the above file, we will modify the VotingData class and the VotingDataSerializer object to help enable our logic using this as a guide to help us make steps up to the level of accuracy that we desire:
